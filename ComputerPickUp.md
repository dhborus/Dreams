# Thoughts on Computers and Workflow

## 18 March 2020

All Mac -- although there is much to dislike about Apple as a company and a technology, I have the equipment and may as well stick with what I have. MacBook is set up -- can use it as desktop and mobile device. With iPad as alternative.

Could transfer with GitHub, of course. Will preserve for Linux, when I make the move. (Which I will). Write with Atom and IA Writer. Zettler for notes. Not sure I will use MMC.

DT3 as storage and clip service. Scapple for jottings, preliminary outlines, and idea connection.

Zotero as bibliography program. Firefox for clipping. Safari for general surfing and note-taking (only because I can do stuff automatically with it).

Will use Quicksilver for awhile, followed by Alfred. There is a learning curve, of course, but in this case a relearning curve.

Devote learning to DevonThink3 and Keyboard Maestro. 

Use Default focus, much less squinting.

Possible Thinkpad for linux -- The x220 and t420 are the last thinkpads to come with the classic keyboard, but the x230 and t430 can be modded to use the classic keyboard too.

Notes -- Subject - body - pandoc citation add hashtags and contexts.
