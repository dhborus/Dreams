Atom still has the best writing environment. If this works, not sure I will mess around with Scrivener.[@abrahams1986, p. 88-92. We'll see if this works.]


Zotero as bibliographic program. Will need to find a way to use Find and Replace to handle editing en masse.

So key apps: Atom (GitHub Desk), DT3, Zotero.

(Interesting that GitHub Desktop works but Atom does not. Allows continued use, so there's that.)

Key elements here:

Can I create pandoc-ready citations from bookends without the @ sign for pages.

Can I sync DT3 from laptop with iPad
