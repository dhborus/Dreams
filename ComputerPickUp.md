# Thoughts on Computers and Workflow

Three choices:

A. iMac - iPad thru iCloud, (or Working Copy)

B. iMac - MacBook -- through Github

C. MacBook -- iPad -- through Working Copy.

Question comes down to sunk costs and time. Do I want to regard the money spent on Mac gear and apps something I need to use . . . Or anticipate greater costs down the road and begin the transition to Linux.

Whichever, clearly moved to plain text. So, no Scrivener (Ulysses) or much else. Zotero rather than Bookends. Also using iA Writer or GitHub for notes. Switch to Firefox, copy article, past next file.

Lot of this doesn't matter. Won't abandon iPad for movies, reading, or notes and shopping list. Might as well keep it. Could use laptop for some mobility, but not really necessary to do so.

1. 11” iPad as basic work machine. MagicKeyboard for home; Brydge for mobile. Or Brydge throughout. Former makes the 11'' the prime, if not sole device. Latter makes the 11'' a laptop. Sunk costs suggest latter. Especially with fiction reading possible on the Kindle.

2. notes in iA Writer/Zettlr or MMC on iMac. Indexed in DT3.

3. Review and cull in DevonThink3

4. Move to writing app. Premature to worry about. Quick thoughts: Scrivener is a remarkable and full-featured app. Dropbox can be a pain to sync, but has the advantage of keeping work within the same environment. Wish I had iCloud instant synchronization but that seems unlikely to happen. iA Writer - A/Z combination can be a bit clunky on transfer -- writing is less fluid in iA Writer while Zettlr lacks a second editor and Atom is harder to sync with the iPad. Zettlr and Atom both have wonderful citation system and have little tricks such as [].

6. Bibliography - Bookends - iMac (might switch to Zotero if way to create items on iPad), but having trouble with Amazon

7. Notes -- Subject - body - pandoc citation add hashtags and contexts.

8. old iPad in portrait for reading with Kindle for fiction; new for work in split screen with iA Writer.
