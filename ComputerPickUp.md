Five key programs -- Atom/Scrivener, DT3, Bookends/Zotero:

For writing, Scrivener and Atom are more or less interchangeable -- Serve as backup for each other. Simply  copy day's writing to the other before shut down. Atom is really in anticipation of Linux shift -- which is about two years away. Scrivener has the advantage of iPad syncing and use.

Bookends is the better bibliographic program, plus is a sunk cost.[Helps that autocomplete-bibtex is up and at 'em now. See @baldwin2012, p. 42]

Zotero gives a bigger bib file -- although it can be a json one and the zotero citation will enable more compact page, prefix and suffix in citations.

DT3 as library and storage.

<!-- Should I take notes in DT3? -->

So -- Scrivener notes, Bookends, and copy to DT3.[@drucker1961, p. 62]
