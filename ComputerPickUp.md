Thoughts 10 December

Have decided that Linux the way to go, at least for the moment.

﻿# Thoughts on Computers and Workflow

10 December 2019

No more futzing around. Really tired of Apple retreat from user friendliness -- so DT3, extra hardware waste, money grubbing, politics, and cult.

Have moved toward Linux future. Manjaro on MacBook, using Atom and GitHub. iPad for Kindle reading and iA Writer notes. Latter retrieved through iCloud download. Might think about Working Copy.

Things to do
* Make sure Git Hub works (It does)

* SSH -- works.

8 December 2019:

Manjaro and Linux writ large has proven to be more attractive and workable than I thought. Which is, of course, not unexpected and complicates decisions.

Have four options:

1. Mac only - Scrivener and DevonThink (where the money is invested). [Perhaps more complicated than I need and seems to force work to use the tools of the apps, even as both preach use what you need). Does allow for the use of the iPad as a work machine.

2. Mac only -- plain text. Atom and iA Writer through iCloud, with clippings from the DevonThink universe.

3. Mac - Linux -- through plain text -- Git Hub and presumably Dropbox for minimal transfer. That is probably too complicated down the road. Advantage -- Pandoc my way to .docx output. Could do ODT. Will require Linux upgrade.

4. Investigate a Linux only regime. Desktop and Laptop and investigation of tablets. Can sync between android tablet and computer. Can also do it with iPad, at least in Mint.

Number 1 is probably easiest, actually. But less apealing. In part, the hipness factor; in part the "heaviness" of Scrivener and the really complicated synchronization involved in Dropbox. Features might be useful, but I have become accustomed to plain text and workarounds. To be fair, Dropbox comes into play in options three and four, but 1) these will be text files and not Scrivener's projects and 2) there are other cloud services -- NextCloud, for instance -- that may work as well.

Number 2 makes sense, given the amount of commitment I have made to the iPad as a work machine. Really shouldn't treat them as sunk costs. Integration with Kindle is important here.

Number 3 Atom is Scrivener-like but 1) clearly more adjustable and 2) does allow movement between the two OS families. Could imagine a workflow in which I keep files in GitHub and the iPad and transfer the ones I *change* through Dropbox.

Manjaro has some better wonderful apps. But for all the talk of stability, I remember that it wasn't quite. Elementary looks the best but doesn't quite have the range of apps or the customization of Mint. Mint is probably the best choice but at the moment, I think it is dull.

* like Kate, Okular, and KDE apps, if not the customization.

* Need to check Dropbox and if I can get into the server. If not, could convert it into a Linux box (of Manjaro). Otherwise serves an important role. Or at least could.

* stick with Manjaro until it breaks. Need to copy Home directory. If it fails go to Elementary OS. Might if wireless continues to act up. Which it hasn't so far. Do worry about all the dependencies I have created here. But Elementary is the fallback. (Turns out the mail program doesn't work. Am downloading Linux Mint, but will start out with Elementary)

* Manjaro sputtered as I expected, although my constant downloading of apps was the proximate problem. Not thrilled with the ways in which Elementary functions. The absence of menu bars and functions can be irksome, especially with Files. Might try to stick it out a couple of days and then shift back to Mint.

Thoughts 08 September 2019

1. 11” iPad as basic work machine. MagicKeyboard for home; Brydge for mobile. Or Brydge throughout. Former makes the 11'' the prime, if not sole device. Latter makes the 11'' a laptop. Sunk costs suggest latter. Especially with fiction reading possible on the Kindle.

2. notes in iA Writer/Zettlr or MMC on iMac. Indexed in DT3.

3. Review and cull in DevonThink3

4. Move to writing app. Premature to worry about. Quick thoughts: Scrivener is a remarkable and full-featured app. Dropbox can be a pain to sync, but has the advantage of keeping work within the same environment. Wish I had iCloud instant synchronization but that seems unlikely to happen. iA Writer - A/Z combination can be a bit clunky on transfer -- writing is less fluid in iA Writer while Zettlr lacks a second editor and Atom is harder to sync with the iPad. Zettlr and Atom both have wonderful citation system and have little tricks such as [].

6. Bibliography - Bookends - iMac (might switch to Zotero if way to create items on iPad), but having trouble with Amazon

7. Notes -- Subject - body - pandoc citation add hashtags and contexts.

8. old iPad in portrait for reading with Kindle for fiction; new for work in split screen with iA Writer.
