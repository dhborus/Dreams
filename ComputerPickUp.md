Atom still has the best writing environment. If this works, not sure I will mess around with Scrivener.[@abrahams1986, p. 88-92. We'll see if this works.]

Key Issue: Can DevonSync work on laptop. If yes, DT# note-taking, Atom write up on laptop -- notes also on iPad.

Zotero as bibliographic program. Will need to find a way to use Find and Replace to handle editing en masse.

So key apps: Atom (GitHub Desk), DT3, Zotero
