Freud - Dreams

Appeared in the United States 1912 - 3 Brill translation
The first translation from German into English was completed by A. A. Brill, a Freudian psychoanalyst. Years later, an authorized translation by James Strachey was published. The most recent English translation is by Joyce Crick.[Will need to check the Crick edition.]

Theories of the Self by Jerome David Levin makes the argument for the evolution of selfhood.

SF calls dreams "the first link in a chain of abnormal psychic structures whose other links, the hysterical phobia, the obsession, and the delusion must, for practical reasons, claim the interest of the physician."[@freud2017, p. 5]

dreams not practical but theoretically valuable "and one who cannot explain the origin of the dream pictures will strive in vain to understand the phobias, obsessive and delusional ideas, and likewise their therapeutic importance." [@freud2017, p. 5]

### material Freud's own dreams
way to get to dream processes unavailable in reports of dream. Had to resist the temptation of disguising and obscuring through omissions and substitutions. [@freud2017, p. 5]

By 3rd edition, Freud is acknowledging greater pull of symbolism

### Purpose (1st sentence)

In the following pages I shall prove that there exists a psychological technique by which dreams may be interpreted, and that upon the application of this method every dream will show itself to be a sensible psychological structure which may be introduced into an assignable place in the psychic activity of the waking state. explain the processes which give rise to the strangeness and obscurity of the dream, and to discover through them the nature of the psychic forces which operate, whether in combination or in opposition, to produce the dream. This accomplished, my investigation will terminate, as it will have reached the point where the problem of the dream meets with broader problems, the solution of which must be attempted through other material.[freud2017, p. 10]

### Aristotle

Aristotle first to see the dream as a product of the dreaming mind. Belief in dream as divine inspiration created view of dreams as creating distinction between true and false or misleading dreams. Reality was projected to the outer view but really constituted inner view and the reason that memory of dream in the morning rather than the psychic content made it seem strange, from another world. [@freud2017 p. 10]

(Freud's interest is in the scientific knowledge of dreams, clearly most people do not have **that** interest.)

### Dream as release or extension of waking life

dream about wine for Napoleon seems to indicate no connection


### dreams as having seemingly trivial material
Ellis remark quoted. This, of course, the reason for dismissal.

### Stimuli
objective firmest source, only known to layman. Dream explained by recognized objective stimulus. But does not appear in true form.
The key to the Freudian approach is the recognition that the same stimuli -- a ticking clock, for instance--produces different dreams, leading him to point out that what needs to be explained is *why* specific results and no others occur. [@freud2017, p. 25]

Dream here is an illusion (links up with other Freudian concerns. Sensory impression "Is classed with the memory group to which it belongs according to all previous experience." and needs reflection. If not, becomes indistinct and an illusion -- give rise because "the impression evokes a greater or lesser number of memory pictures through which the impression receives its psychic value. In which of the many spheres of memory to be taken into consideration the corresponding pictures are aroused, and which of the possible association connections thereby come into force, this, even according to Strumpell, remains indeterminable, and is left, as it were to the caprice of the psychic life." [@freud2017, p. 27].

### Freudian reaction to the unpredictability of responses to stimuli

Either admit no laws of dream formation or suppose objective sensory stimulus plays only modest part as dream source. [@freud2017, p. 27]

So, if not objective stimuli, perhaps subjective (emotional) stimuli. 


### Central Assumption


In the scientific investigation of the dream we start with the assumption that the dream is an occurrence of our own psychic activity; nevertheless the finished dream appears to us as something strange, the authorship of which we are so little forced to recognize that we can just as easily say a rem appeared to me as I have dreamt. [@freud2017, p. 40] 

### Making Scientific sense of the dream

That the mind withdraws from the outer world does not fully explain the strangeness of the dream. Should be able to change back "the hallucinations of the dream into presentations and the situations of the dram into thoughts, and thus to perform the task of dream interpretations." (43) We do this when awakening but "the dream still retains its mysteriousness." 

### Freud's singularity

Freud quotes a number of authorities to the effect that dreams are incoherent, illogical, and confusing. Wrote one, "It is as if the psychological activity were transferred from the brain of a reasonable being into the brain of a fool." absurd actions have no firm law.
