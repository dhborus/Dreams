Title:

Content: Aristotle first to see the dream as a product of the dreaming mind. Belief in dream as divine inspiration created view of dreams as creating distinction between true and false or misleading dreams. Reality was projected to the outer view but really constituted inner view and the reason that memory of dream in the morning rather than the psychic content made it seem strange, from another world. [@freud2017 p. 10]

(Freud's interest is in the scientific knowledge of dreams, clearly most people do not have **that** interest.)
