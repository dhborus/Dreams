Title: Making Scientific sense of the Dream

Content: That the mind withdraws from the outer world does not fully explain the strangeness of the dream. Should be able to change back "the hallucinations of the dream into presentations and the situations of the dram into thoughts, and thus to perform the task of dream interpretations." (43) We do this when awakening but "the dream still retains its mysteriousness."
