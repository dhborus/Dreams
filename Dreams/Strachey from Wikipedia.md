### Strachey from Wikipedia

The most 'obvious flaw in this translation was the substitution of esoteric neologisms for the plain German terms Freud preferred',[18] so that for example his "I" and his "It" become the Ego and the Id. Lacan took particular exception to "the translation of instinct for Trieb [drive] ... thus basing the whole edition on a complete misunderstanding since Trieb and instinct have nothing in common".[19] Bruno Bettelheim went still further, arguing that "anyone who reads Freud only in Strachey's English translation cannot understand Freud's concern with man's soul".[17]

While accepting that "Strachey's translation was also an act of interpretation and it has not been hard to find spots where he went astray", the fact remains that "Freud was delighted with the work Strachey succeeded in doing"; whilst even into the twenty-first century "the German editions have relied on Strachey's editorial apparatus, which should be a testimony to what he accomplished".[20]
