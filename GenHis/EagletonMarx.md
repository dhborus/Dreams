### Eagleton Marx

Business as usual only more so reason for Marxist disillusion [@eagleton2018, p. 7]

Can't leave it that there are detectives and criminals in the world. There are detectives because there are criminals. (poor because there are rich)[@eagleton2018, p. 11]

"Building up an economy from very low levels is a back-breaking, dispiriting task. It is unlikely that men and women will freely submit to the hardships it involves. So unless this project is executed gradually, under democratic control and in accordance with socialist values, an authoritarian state may step in and force its citizens to do what they are reluctant to undertake voluntarily. Th militarisation of labour in Bolshevik Russia is a case in point. Th result, in a grisly irony, will be to undermine the political superstructure of socialism (popular democracy, genuine self-government) in the very attempt to build up its economic base. It would be like being invited to a party only to discover you had not only to bake the cakes and brew the beer but to dig the foundations and lay the floorboards. There wouldn't be much time to enjoy yourself." [@eagleton2018, p. 17]

On market socialism -- keep cooperation at firm level for efficiency and market to insure informational, allocation and incentive problems associated with central planning do not arise. Even in transition, Trotsky thought market would provide check on the adequacy and rationality of planning since "economic accounting is unthinkable without market relations." [@eagleton2018, p. 23-4].

Yet other Marxists hold --commodity production, inequality, unemployment, and the sway of market forces beyond human control. Profit maximization still there, ignoring of social needs and pandering to consumerism still there. planning would required resources allocated by negotiations between producers, consumers, and other relevant parties through networks of workplace, neighborhood, and consumer councils. [@eagleton2018, p. 24-5]

Problem with Marxist history -- why does KM assume that the productive forces keep evolving. true that technological development tends to be cumulative. does not explain much -- why, for instance, do some periods feature rapid evolution and others relative stagnation? "Whether or not there is major technological development depends on prevailing social relations, not on some inbuilt drive. Some Marxists see the compulsion to improve the forces of production not as a general law of history, but as an imperative specific to capitalism. They take issue with the assumption that every mode of production must be followed by a more productive one"[@eagleton2018, p. 38-9]

**Problems** Why same mechanism operate in the shift from one era to another? Why odd constancy? Why political change have to be based on conflict between forces and relations? Couldn't productive forces (technology) actually prevent a class from taking over? "In any case, whether a social class is ripe to make a revolution is shaped by a lot more than whether it has the power to promote the forces of production. Class capacities are moulded by a whole range of facts. And how can we know that a specific set of social relations will be useful for that purpose?" [@eagleton2018, p. 41-2]

**Determinism and Free Will** Similar to Christianity. future kingdom of God is not preordained; it will arrive only if men and women work for it in the present. But the fact that they will work for it of their own free will is itself an inevitable result of God's grace. . . Just as for the Christian human action is free yet part of a preordained plan, so for Marx the disintegration of capitalism will unavoidably lead men and women to sweep it away of their own free will.[@eaglton2018, p. 45-7]
(But this is all predicated on what they would do as rational actors. hs little to say about whether the working class is enfeebled or demoralized. p. 48)

49, 51 km as anti determinist and social relations cause rather than effect, other does appear at great length.

55: every society opens up some possibiliTies and closes down others. not iron clad laws or chaos.

56: Enlightenment vs Marxist view of historical change as disruptive and discontinuous.

60: No inexorability in which each stage is necessary for certain goal. Capitalism can be drawn on for socialism, but does not exist for that reason.

Everyone agrees that that some historical factors are more weighty than others. This does not prevent them from being pluralists, in one sense of the world. [@eagleton2018, 109]
