### Eagleton Marx

Business as usual only more so reason for Marxist disillusion [@eagleton2018, p. 7]

Can't leave it that there are detectives and criminals in the world. There are detectives because there are criminals. (poor because there are rich)[@eagleton2018, p. 11]

"Building up an economy from very low levels is a back-breaking, dispiriting task. It is unlikely that men and women will freely submit to the hardships it involves. So unless this project is executed gradually, under democratic control and in accordance with socialist values, an authoritarian state may step in and force its citizens to do what they are reluctant to undertake voluntarily. Th militarisation of labour in Bolshevik Russia is a case in point. Th result, in a grisly irony, will be to undermine the political superstructure of socialism (popular democracy, genuine self-government) in the very attempt to build up its economic base. It would be like being invited to a party only to discover you had not only to bake the cakes and brew the beer but to dig the foundations and lay the floorboards. There wouldn't be much time to enjoy yourself." [@eagleton2018, p. 17]

On market socialism -- keep cooperation at firm level for efficiency and market to insure informational, allocation and incentive problems associated with central planning do not arise. Even in transition, Trotsky thought market would provide check on the adequacy and rationality of planning since "economic accounting is unthinkable without market relations." [@eagleton2018, p. 23-4].

Yet other Marxists hold --commodity production, inequality, unemployment, and the sway of market forces beyond human control. Profit maximization still there, ignoring of social needs and pandering to consumerism still there. planning would required resources allocated by negotiations between producers, consumers, and other relevant parties through networks of workplace, neighborhood, and consumer councils. [@eagleton2018, p. 24-5]
