Ackerman on Soleimani

Soleimani has been a top U.S. adversary for 15 years, when the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq became a battlefield for Iranian proxy conflict against an Iran that saw itself encircled by the U.S. on both its western and eastern borders. The U.S. blamed Iran both for a wave of powerful bombs that killed and maimed U.S. servicemembers and for frustrating U.S. plans to turn Iraq into a U.S.-aligned Mideast outpost. 

Famously, Soleimani in 2008 texted David Petraeus, then the U.S. military commander in Iraq, that he controlled Iran’s policy in Iraq and was outfoxing the Americans. 

But the U.S. had long feared that taking direct military action against Iran would result in an entirely new, devastating war. The Obama administration, seeking to avert escalation, signed a deal with Iran to forestall its development of a nuclear weapon. In Iraq, U.S. and Iranian forces reached an uneasy, unacknowledged alignment of interests when both fought against the so-called Islamic State.

is stunning  how many people paid to opine about US foreign policy think its purpose, essentially, is to punish the wicked, whatever the consequences. You’d think everyone would see what a profoundly irresponsible approach to policy that is  by now.
