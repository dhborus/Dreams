Thoughts on McGovernism

This is both political and personal. The book is an effort to understand what on its surface seems to be a strange trajectory of McGovern and his staff from the most left-wing tendency in mainstream electoral politics to a generally immovable bulwark of Democratic centrism made up of unquestioned support for "unregulated" markets, incrementalism, and a form of social liberalism predominates. Very much seems a matter of class, of the ways in which PMC has shifted. Not simply a matter of personal failures to maintain radicalism.
