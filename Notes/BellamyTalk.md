Bellamy talk

-- context to understand what is going on in most famous utopian novel written by an American.
-- Read some passages together and try to make sense of them.
-- write whether you would want to live in society Bellamy describes. What is appealing? What is horrible?

So far Greece before the Common Era, France in the 1700s, now America in the late 1800s.

Any differences you can think that might make participating in civic life different?

Want to mention capitalism, industry (use of machines to do work human body once did), and cities class conflict.

Utopian -- combination of "no place" and 'good place'  [show Bellamy]

Emphasize key features -- social provision, social obligation, end of corruption, end of social conflict.[]

What if you like walking in the rain?[@johnson2004 Doubtful much more will come from this]
