New Thoughts on Computers


Love the keyboard on the MacBook. Manjaro is working well at the moment, although I expect it might falter soon.

-- did think Linux as the iMac machine of choice but staying with Manjaro makes a good deal of sense. Like the focus; less likely to multitask.

Not crazy about Linux Mint bootup time.If I'm only using the desktop for Emby, may as well be Mac version of the machine.

Could do home directory. operation. And see if it works. Let's try to speed up boot time first.

Manjaro-MacBook and iPad as daily drivers. iMac when needed (Emby, saved documents and the like)

iMac is pretty damn slow. MacBook is faster. Could try Manjaro one more time. Or slip into MX. But I'm not sure it will make much difference. Perhaps I can move one iMac to the basement, the garage, or something else.
