##Write Up truth and reconciliation

*Have to Start an insert**

Sheesh, that was difficult.

The best-known critiques of the TRC’s proceedings, such as history and politics scholar Mahmood Mamdani’s 2002 paper “Amnesty or Impunity?” and the internal dissent by Commissioner Wynand Malan, the Afrikaner politician who served as vice chair of the TRC, have held that they focused too narrowly on certain individual perpetrators and victims. In doing so, the commission elided historical context, emphasizing violent acts but not broader and more systemic forms of discrimination, and obscuring their deep-seated causes in the social order that was taken for granted and rationalized under apartheid rule. As Mamdani pointed out, the commission held institutional hearings only as background to the individual ones, when it perhaps could have worked the other way around—individual testimony offered to illuminate what was done structurally, to large groups of people. Malan criticized the “religious thought” that framed the commission’s approach. It focused on individual questions of personal redemption or repentance or forgiveness, rather than making a “real historical evaluation of roles played by various actors.”

Mamdani argues that “reconciliation cannot be between victims and perpetrators; it can only be between survivors.” A theoretical goal of reconciliation commissions is to dissociate the perpetrator from his or her act, and allow the state to take responsibility for redressing past wrongs. This strikes you as a more promising starting point than permanently linking perpetrator and act, as banishment does. It must be possible to acknowledge, without descending into relativism, that power doesn’t corrupt only the most powerful. The aim should be not to minimize individual responsibility but to contextualize it better, and to allow it to produce something more constructive than humiliation. 

Black women invented #MeToo, and they have spent generations developing tools to reduce violence and increase accountability within communities, tools that might offer the only serious place to go next in tackling workplace culture (and the dethroned men). Such grassroots approaches, developed collaboratively by groups such as Creative Interventions, Critical Resistance, and Incite!, aim to help people recognize and reduce the harm they are doing to those around them, to take responsibility and move toward new ways of coexisting, without involving entities like police or government institutions. They take for granted that groups and communities contribute to violent dynamics between individuals, and that they can also help change them. They respect the autonomy and specific wishes of those harmed in figuring out how to address the abuses. These are the rare approaches in which pragmatism and ambition are equally present. If you start with the recognition that institutions serve and protect themselves, that the option of aligning yourself with whoever is already in power isn’t open to you, then you can understand both how nearly impossible your position is and how nonviable it would be to simply accept its impossibility.

lol it's actually exactly like this

except there is no music

and there are no hors d'oeuvres

and the house is a cell

and cops are shouting at you

and your children have been taken

and you have to stay the night

and the next night

and you can't wash

and it never ends

🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
