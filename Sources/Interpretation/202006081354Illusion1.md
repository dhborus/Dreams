Title: Stimuli 2

Content: Dream here is an illusion (links up with other Freudian concerns. Sensory impression "Is classed with the memory group to which it belongs according to all previous experience." and needs reflection. If not, becomes indistinct and an illusion -- give rise because "the impression evokes a greater or lesser number of memory pictures through which the impression receives its psychic value. In which of the many spheres of memory to be taken into consideration the corresponding pictures are aroused, and which of the possible association connections thereby come into force, this, even according to Strumpell, remains indeterminable, and is left, as it were to the caprice of the psychic life." [@freud2017, p. 27].

Either admit no laws of dream formation or suppose objective sensory stimulus plays only modest part as dream source. [@freud2017, p. 27]

So, if not objective stimuli, perhaps subjective (emotional) stimuli.
