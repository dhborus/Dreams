### African American interest in Freudianism
related to family separation. Coming to grips with history through mourning. Working through collective memory. (lived, for most part, in ultimate patriarchal society -- master's house) [@zaretsky2017, p. 39]

### Parallel between Hegelian master-slave stages and Black intellectual developments
key to argument that double conscious, identity as free person, master dependent and slave's consciousness exists for itself -- Harlem R, Pop Front, postcolonialism. tends to be more political and collective than with white as private. [@zaretsky2017, p. 39-40]

#### Comment
when Zaretsky writes, p. 40 that the blues are closely linked to psychoanalysis because they are the first real personal musical form -- the word link is doing quite a bit of work.

### Blues pain without self-pity
(#DQ) From Ellison -- The Blues as an  "impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one's aching consciousness, to ginger its jagged grain, and to transcend it, not by the consolation of philosophy but by squeezing from it a near tragic, near comic lyricism.''

### Follow up on Comment
blues were the construction of black memory. Psychoanalysis put memory at the center of all human strivings toward freedom. Less recall of objective knowledge of the past than the subjective process of mastering the past so that it becomes part of one's identity. [@zaretsky2017, p. 41]
