### Psychoanalysis and the Spirit of Capitalism

Notes on Chapter One. p. 198 on what Adam Smith and political economy took for granted. 

capitalism always required a spirit, have changed, second industrial revolution depended on charisma -- individuals who "motivate followers by giving personal expression to new goals or ideas." Interesting claim about the ideas -- neither reflect or cause change, serve as catalysts. Charisma guarantees that the aspirations and legitimations that accompany social change will be rooted at an inward and personal level. [@zaretsky2017, p. 17]

EZ terms psychoanalysis the Calvinism of the Second Industrial Revolution on the grounds of centrality of family relations and personal life. (Freud (in analogy to Jesus, leave your family (i.e. archaic image) for more enriched personal life. Accepts that little mention about economy per se and admits that Keynes with spending praise rather than saving pivotal. [@zaretsky2017, p. 18]

**Desire to be free from spirit of 19c capitalism**  
(#MP) for EZ, this is personal life -- having an identity distinct from one' place in the family, in society, and social division of labor. Key is historical specificity of separation of family and paid work meant new forms of privacy and intimacy. PI now a problem and project; analysis "theory and practice of this new aspiration for a personal life." [@zaretsky2017, p. 20]  
**Tags**: #analysis ; #history #personal

**Cultural importance of analysis**  
(#MP) freeing of individuals from unconscious images of authority; unconscious and sexuality itself reconceived as beyond social and family place. sleeper completely separated from real world [really? day residue? point of interpretation?] "No thought that comes to the individual --whether it originated in childhood or comes from the 'day residues' . . . -- is directly registered; rather it is first dissolved and internally reconstituted in such a way as to give it a unique and contingent meaning." Psychoanalysis interprets through divorce from collectivities, and relate more affirmatively to their depths. [@zaretsky2017, 21]

**Freudian sexuality**
(#MP) key shift -- sexuality not gender difference aimed at reproduction but distinction between libido and repression. interest in object choice. Psychoanalysis uniquely recognized every personal had a special individuality in the exercise of his capacity to love -- in the conditions he or she sets up for loving and the in the impulses he gratifies by it, and in the aims he sets out to achieve in it. [@zaretsky2017, p. 22]

**sexuality at center of psychology**
offers key to breaking iron cage. [@zaretsky2017, p. 23]

**Three assists of Calvinism**
calling (production for own sake not need per se), compulsion, acquisition. analysis qualified asceticism (through instinct), challenged repression, and circle of guilt. [@zaretsky2017, p. 25]

*new sense of autonomy*
compare Kant (find universal moral code) to SF (personal goals through capabilities) followed by shift in analysis from defamiliarization to refamiliazation [@zaretsky2017, p, 27]

**Object relations**
obviously new set of words, emphasis on mother, but also ethical responsibility -- now less a mater of observing universal moral norms than of meeting concrete obligations to particular others. Bloomsbury's transfamilial sociality. less id, etc. than attachment, loss, and mourning. England, of course.  
In US -- analysis took on responsibility and adulthood ethos, lined to a new maturity in America's global role. Key was the postwar rejection of radical politics and the insistence that freedom in the private realm." Arendt's totalitarianism takes to private sphere; old-fashioned tyranny just the public. Erikson's mature person who was "tolerant of differences, cautious and methodical in evaluation, just in judgment, circumspect in action, and capable of faith and indignation." [@zaretsky2017, p. 29-31]

**Summary of absorption**.   
stress on private life, normalized Keynesian welfare state. emphasized power from the inside of individuals. "Thus absorbed, ego psychology functioned as a form of social control." 

New charisma to the family set out forces that couldn't fully be contained. domesticity took on the role previously reserved for personal life. "By the 1960s, aninomian upsurged inspired by a Freudian spirit would overflow the boundaries of the analytic profession, the heterosexual family, and the welfare state. Simultaneously normalizing and fuelded by charismatic sources, then, analysis was at the center of *both* the growing rationalization of personal life unfolding in the 1950s *and* the looming critique of rationalization, the charismatic rejextion of the mundane that came to the fore in the 1960s." [@zaretsky2017, p. 31-2]

**New Leftish challenges to Analysis**. 
ideology of intersubjectivity, validation of narcissism, feminism. rejection of the durable unique personality and the so-called stigmatization. relational theories helped advanced post-Fordist information based capitalism with shifting networks, and deterritorialized flows. "The idea of a personal life interior to the individual was repudiated in favor of an emphasis on flexibility, sociality, and sensitivity to difference."

narcissism -- once obstacle autonomy now in favor expressiveness (which validated narcissism). validated an environment that produces relationships, not things -- and let image, personality, and interpersonal skills come to the fore. 

aided by family revolution of the 1960s -- led to feminism treating psychologizing as social oppression. [@zaretsky2017, p. 35-6]

**End Times, or the Summary**. 
both emancipation and "pseudo-science." Makes sense . . . "when we realized that, on the one hand, it gave voice to the emancipatory aspiration that served as a critique of the first industrial revolution while, on the other, those aspirations were recuperated within a revised spirit of capitalism corresponding to the second."
